"Within the prudential framework, banks are subject to risk-based requirements, including capital buffers, which are expressed in terms of risk-weighted assets and reflect the risk profile of a bank’s balance sheet, as well as leverage ratio requirements, which are non-risk-weighted measures to prevent the build-up of excessive leverage. In terms of resolution requirements, EU banks are subject to the Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), expressed both in risk-weighted and non-risk-weighted terms, with additional Total Loss-absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements for EU-headquartered globally significant institutions."
"These requirements affect banks’ capital levels, as well as their liabilities in relation to their assets. Prudential requirements generally require banks to hold own funds, i.e. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1 (AT1) or Tier 2 (T2) instruments. Capital buffers must be met with CET1 capital alone, while resolution requirements allow for a broader range of instruments, including senior debt, thus offering banks additional flexibility in how they choose to comply. Notably, CET1 capital, being the highest-quality instrument, can be simultaneously used by banks to satisfy all parallel requirements, leading to complex interactions and overlaps among the frameworks."
"In accordance with the principle of proportionality, less significant credit institutions and less significant branches are subject to reduced reporting requirements under Regulation (EU) 2015/534 (ECB/2015/13). In particular, only a reduced set of data points specified in Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2015/534 (ECB/2015/13) is collected from certain less significant credit institutions subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/534 (ECB/2015/13) which have a total asset value of EUR 3 billion or less."
"In order to exercise oversight over the functioning of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and to promote the consistent application of high supervisory standards, the ECB needs additional data points concerning these less significant credit institutions. The additional information is necessary for the ECB to foster comparability of the outcomes of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) assessment."
